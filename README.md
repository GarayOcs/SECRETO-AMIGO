# SECRET-FRIEND

**It's 10:58 PM, and honestly, I struggled more with GitHub than with the actual code.**  
But hey, here we are. Let me introduce you to my project, **SECRET-FRIEND**, a simple yet functional app to organize secret santa draws. Because if I learned anything today, it’s that the problems aren’t in the code... they’re in the _push_.

---

## 📝 Project Description

This is a simple web app that helps you organize secret santa draws without using paper slips or trusting someone who always spills the beans. 🤫

### **What does it do?**
1. Lets you **add friends**.
2. Performs a **random draw** and assigns each person a secret santa.
3. Displays the results directly on the page (without anyone seeing who got who).

### **Why did I create this?**
This project was born as a challenge to strengthen my skills in:
- **Programming logic.**
- Using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
- My patience (thank you, GitHub).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Project structure.
- **CSS3**: Basic styling with variables and flexbox.
- **JavaScript**: The magic behind the draw.
- **Git and GitHub**: Where I almost lost my sanity but eventually succeeded.

🧠 Lessons Learned

Git isn’t hard, but it’s not easy either: When learning Git, remember to stock up on patience and snacks.
Organization matters: Keeping your code organized is key (thank you, commits, for making it work, somehow).
Persistence pays off: If you’re reading this, it means I finally made it. 🚀

📌 Final Note

If you’re struggling with your own project, remember: Everything is hard until you make it happen. And if not, I’m here to help. 😎
