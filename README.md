It's 10:58 PM, and honestly, I struggled more with GitHub than with the actual code.
But hey, here we are. Let me introduce you to my project, Amigo Secreto, a simple yet functional app to organize secret santa draws. Because if I learned anything today, it’s that the problems aren’t in the code... they’re in the push.

📝 Project Description
This is a simple web app that helps you organize secret santa draws without using paper slips or trusting someone who always spills the beans. 🤫

What does it do?
Lets you add friends.
Performs a random draw and assigns each person a secret santa.
Displays the results directly on the page (without anyone seeing who got who).
Why did I create this?
This project was born as a challenge to strengthen my skills in:

Programming logic.
Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
My patience (thank you, GitHub).
🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Project structure.
CSS3: Basic styling with variables and flexbox.
JavaScript: The magic behind the draw.
Git and GitHub: Where I almost lost my sanity but eventually succeeded.

🚀 How to Use the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar
Editar
git clone https://github.com/GarayOcs/SECRETO-AMIGO.git
Open the index.html file in your browser.

Use the interface to:

Add friends' names.
Perform the draw.
View the results.

🧠 Lessons Learned
Git isn’t hard, but it’s not easy either: When learning Git, remember to stock up on patience and snacks.
Organization matters: Keeping your code organized is key (thank you, commits, for making it work, somehow).
Persistence pays off: If you’re reading this, it means I finally made it. 🚀
✨ Credits
Project developed by GarayOcs while battling GitHub and late-night fatigue.

📌 Final Note
If you’re struggling with your own project, remember: Everything is hard until you make it happen. And if not, I’m here to help. 😎
